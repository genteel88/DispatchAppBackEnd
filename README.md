# DispatchApp BackEnd

# Introduction

We are a logistics company with ground robot assistants and drones to help users in San Francisco deliver small and medium-sized items. We have a total of 3 distribution stations in the city.

We developed a web app based on MVP pattern in agile development that enable users to place order and track packages delivery. Alternative approaches in implementation are suggested.

The main application stacks used in backend are Spring/Spring Boot/Spring Security, Hibernate/MySQL, Google MAP API, et al.
